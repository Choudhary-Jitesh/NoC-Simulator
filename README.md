# System-C-based-NoC-Simulator
**Introduction**

This Read Me file is for the Virtual Channel Simulators developed in MPLab, IIT Kharagpur by the team of Researchers. Dr. Soumya J is one of the developer of this Simulator.
This is a System C based cycle accurate NoC simulator. Cycle Accurate NoC simulator provide accurate performance evaluation of NoC designs by modeling the behavior of the system at the cycle level. This simulator allow designers to evaluate the performance of the NoC under different traffic patterns and routing algorithms. They also enable designers to identify potential bottlenecks and optimize the NoC design before actual implementation. System C is a popular modeling language for designing and simulating complex systems, including NoCs. It provides a high-level abstraction that enables designers to focus on the functionality of the system, rather than its implementation details. System C is widely used in the design and simulation of digital systems, especially in the field of embedded systems. A System C based Cycle Accurate NoC simulator offers several benefits. It provides accurate performance evaluation of the NoC design, enables designers to explore different design choices, and facilitates the identification of potential bottlenecks.
